Welcome! This one page document is a short introduction to the codebar brand. It is very much work in progress and is meant to give you a high level overview about the Dos and Donts of the codebar brand.

## Assets

All of our assets can be downloaded from our [assets GitHub repository](https://github.com/codebar/assets).

### Logo

Our logo, mark and wordmark comes in two colour ways. Additionally, our logo comes in vertical and horizontal versions.

#### Logo

#### Horizontal version of the logo

Used in cases where a horizontal logo fits better, e.g. site headers, etc.

#### The mark

Use the mark when you have to represent codebar and only have a small area to do so. The mark works best as a profile picture, avatar, icon, etc.

#### Chapter logos

Additionally, each chapter has it's own logo with the name of the city in it:

## Font & typography

The wordmark is a modified version of codebar written in Gotham Light. You can download this font from the internet. If you need to edit any of our assets, please use this font by downloading it and including it in your font library.

## Language

- We **always** write codebar with a lowercase c, as opposed to a capital C. This is true even if codebar is the first word in a sentence!

- When we refer to codebar in writing we use the short verison - codebar - as opposed to the long version - codebar.io - which we use in the logos.

- The different codebar locations are called chapters. When we refer to a specific codebar chapter, we write codebar first and then the chapter name we are referring to.
