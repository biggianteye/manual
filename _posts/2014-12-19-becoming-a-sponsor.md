### How to sponsor a workshop

- Depending on the location workshop attendee numbers can range from as low as 10 to as high as 60, so for exact details you should send an email to hello@codebar.io enquiring about the specifics of a chapter.

- The minimum requirements for hosting a workshop are desk space, power outlets, and a stable internet connection

- We encourage providing food and drinks. Since our workshops typically take place immediately after work for many students and coaches, it is recommended that hosts provide some hot food, as attendees will not have another chance to eat dinner. In London, the typical spend for hot food is roughly £200-250 for one workshop; outside of central London it can be much lower.

  - Food options: try to provide some vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options - everyone will eat vegetarian food but not the other way around so try to keep it at a 50-50.  If you would like recommendations for food, please get in touch with your chapter organisers.
  - Drinks: Please make sure you provide non-alcoholic drinks and water. Some locations also prefer to keep their workshop alcohol free so make sure you speak with the organisers  if you are planning on providing beer or wine.


- Some chapters hold lightning talks at the start of each event. If your space has a larger conference room with a projector (preferably HDMI and/or with an adapter for Mac Thunderports) please let us know in advance and have it ready to go on the day of the workshop.

- Make sure your location is clearly visible  from the street or the Google Places API,  and post signs to codebar for the attendees to more easily find the venue.

### About codebar

codebar is a not-for-profit organisation that has been running weekly coding workshops since October 2013, with London as its first chapter. Since then we have expanded to running workshops in 15 different cities from  Brighton to Manchester and Edinbrugh, New York, Berlin, Sydney and the list goes on.

We have coached over 1000 students, with new people attending our events every week and a long waiting list at our London events. This has grown our developer base rapidly in a short period of time but it has also substantially increased demand for space, coaches and resources. This in turn requires a substantial expansion in sponsorship investment so that we can not just run workshops across London smoothly, but also be able to provide help and support to our smaller chapters.

If you are a sponsor interested in helping get codebar started in your city, we'd be delighted to talk to you about how you can help with hosting and sponsoring regular events.

All of codebar’s events are run on a volunteer basis, with every subject expert and coach giving their time for free.

### Why should you sponsor?

As a codebar sponsor, you will be part of the vibrant community facilitating the growth of a diverse community. We have a strict yet simple [code of conduct](https://codebar.io/code-of-conduct) that includes more detailed information.

You will be helping to promote diversity within the tech sector and be part of an exciting community committed to narrowing the skills gap. Not only that, but you will also be contributing to the growth of much-needed technical skills giving a further boost to the post-recession economy.

Your sponsorship will enable more women, LGBTQ and people from under-represented minority groups to get started in development, or raise their skills to the next level. You will also have contact with developers of all levels at our workshops. Many of codebar’s students have found jobs as a direct result of the time they have invested to learn and develop their coding skills with us.

Whatever investment you choose, your logo will appear on the codebar website along with a link to your site. You are also welcome to give a 5 minute talk at the beginning of an evening workshop you host on a topic you think our students will find interesting and informative.


### How can you sponsor?

There are different ways that you can help and support our vibrant and growing community. You can be a regular workshop supporter and offer your venue and food to a substantial amount of workshops taking place in your area or be a workshop supporter and help by taking care of one of our workshops every now and then.

We also welcome monetary sponsorship to help us cover other expenses. The best way to make a monetary contribution is to use our online [donation portal](https://donate.codebar.io).
