### About codebar

codebar is a charity that has been running free weekly coding workshops since October 2013, with London as its first chapter. Since then we have expanded to running workshops in 23 different cities around the world, from Brighton, Manchester, Edinburgh, New York City, Berlin and Sydney, and the list goes on.

We have coached over 12,000 students, with new people attending our events every week. Because of this our developer base has grown rapidly in a short period of time, but it has also substantially increased demand for space, coaches and resources. This in turn requires a substantial expansion in sponsorship investment so that we can not just run workshops, but also be able to provide help and support to our smaller chapters.

All of codebar’s events are run on a volunteer basis, with every subject expert and coach giving their time for free.

### Why should you sponsor?

As a codebar sponsor, you will be part of the vibrant community facilitating the growth of a diverse community. We have a strict yet simple [code of conduct](https://codebar.io/code-of-conduct) that includes more detailed information.

You will be helping to promote diversity within the tech sector and be part of an exciting community committed to narrowing the skills gap. Not only that, but you will also be contributing to the growth of much-needed technical skills and giving a further boost to the post-recession economy.

Your sponsorship will enable more women, non-binary, LGBTQ+ and ethnic minorities to get started in development, or raise their skills to the next level. You will also have contact with developers of all levels at our workshops. Many of codebar’s students have found jobs as a direct result of the time they have invested to learn and develop their coding skills with us.

Whatever investment you choose, your logo will appear on the codebar website along with a link to your site. You are also welcome to give a 5 minute talk at the beginning of an evening workshop you host on a topic you think our students will find interesting and informative.


### How can you sponsor?

There are different ways that you can help and support our vibrant and growing community. You can be a regular workshop supporter and offer your venue and food to a substantial amount of workshops taking place in your area or be a workshop supporter and help by taking care of one of our workshops every now and then.

We also welcome monetary sponsorship to help us cover other expenses. The best way to make a monetary contribution is to use our online [donation portal](https://codebar.enthuse.com/donate/#!/).

You can also come on board as a codebar partner, this will be a 12 month partnership were we will collaborate several times throughout the 12 months. If you're interested in this option, please drop us an email <hello@codebar.io>.


### Why sponsor us

Women in the UK make up 46% of the workforce but in technology the number drops to less than 20%. Stereotypes, socio-psychological factors, external barriers such as male-dominated environments and a lack of role models in the sector are some of the contributing factors.

Supporting us means you provide women, non-binary, LGBTQ+, and ethnic minorities the tools to get started with their development career and further current skills.

Sponsoring us is also a great way to attract fresh and passionate talent to your company and to show your active efforts in tackling the industry’s diversity problem.


#### What your sponsorship money is being used for

- Our infrastructure costs (we pay all services we use to manage both technical and administrative aspects of codebar from hosting, to accounting etc)
- Promotional materials to help get the word out
- Support for chapters that are at times unable to find local sponsorship for their workshops
- Running more specialised events (all our events are free and run by volunteers - but we still need to handle food catering, marketing, planning and other administrative costs)

### What do you get in return?

Whatever your investment, you can be proud knowing that you are an active member of this flourishing sector, enabling people to find jobs, enhance their existing careers and substantially improve the quality of life of those who are often discriminated against.

Depending on your level of sponsorship, we will also list your logo and link on our website, thank you on Twitter, mention you in our bi-monthly newsletter and you will be welcome to distribute your marketing collateral at our events.

We look forward to welcoming you to our evolving community!
