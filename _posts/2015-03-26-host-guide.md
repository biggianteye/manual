### Running a codebar workshop

So you've decided to become a sponsor and host a codebar workshop. Thank you very much, without your support codebar would not happen so we really appreciate it! Now, here's what you need to know to run a successful codebar workshop. 

#### Before the workshop

- Find a food supplier for the event. If you need help finding places to order from, get in touch with the codebar organiser and they'll help you find a place.

- As well as food, most of our sponsors provides drinks too. If you are planning on serving alcohol, please supply a non-alcoholic option too. Please at least supply water. 

- Check if you have suitable WiFi in your office/event space. If you are expecting more than 20 people at the workshop, plan for a large number of people all trying to connect to the network at once.

- Make sure you have enough power outlets in the space you are planning to use. If not, it might be a good idea to purchase some extension cables as people may need to plug their laptops in.

- Some workshops have a lightning talk so access to a projector or TV would be great. If you would like to do a lightning talk at the workshop you are hosting, please let the codebar organisers know in advance so they can plan for it.

- Send us a transparent png version of your logo so we can set you up on the events page on our site. We usually send out invites at least a week in advance of the workshop.

- It would be really helpful if you could print name tags for the workshop. To do this you'll need to buy some generic printing labels. We usually use 2 x 7 layout.

#### On the day of the workshop

- Order the food. Please ask to have it delivered around 6:15PM, as the official start time of the workshop is 6:30PM. Vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options are important too.

- A codebar organiser will send you an email with the final head count and any other details that might've come up beforehand. We can also send you a list of attendees, so if you need this let us know. However, please be aware that the list changes up until the last minute so it might not be 100% accurate. If you are printing name tags we will also send you a formatted PDF that you can use to print the tags.

- If the workshop has a confirmed lightning talk or you are doing one, set up the projector or screen so it's ready to go. It might be a good idea to have a selection of connectors on hand so people with a wide variety of machines can plug into it.

- If it is possible could you please label one of your toilets as gender neutral. We recommend using [this sign.](http://www.uua.org/sites/live-new.uua.org/files/documents/lgbtq/gender_neutral_bathroom_11x17.pdf)

- Please have your (guest) WiFi details displayed in prominent places.

- If there are any further questions you have please don't hesitate to get in touch with any of the codebar team.

#### At the workshop

One of the organisers will be at the venue 30 minutes before official start time, around 6:00PM. They will help you set the space up and check people in.

Enjoy it :)
